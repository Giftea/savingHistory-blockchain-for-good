# Use of Product

Every culture on the planet provides its own answer to the big question, of "**What is it to be human?**" They form our repertoire for dealing with the challenges facing us as a species in the millennia ahead. As a result, the loss of any culture affects humanity.

**savingHistory** is an application layer protocol designed to protect the endangered heritage of different tribes worldwide while creating awareness of their way of life globally. It enables endangered tribes to have their own **_online museum_** stored on the blockchain to tell their stories for years to come.

**savingHistory** mission is to preserve endangered cultures around the world by <u>documenting history, beliefs, customs, and social behavior in the form of articles, images, audio, and video</u>. As a result, an online museum for endangered minority cultures is being created.

# Product Description

People who wish to support the protocol can donate **USDC** to the protocol's treasury. After donating successfully, they will receive some **SAVEH** tokens, which they can claim after an epoch (24 hours). They automatically become DAO members, and they can stake SAVEH tokens to receive **SSAVEH** tokens (stakeSAVEH). The SSAVEH token is the governance tool, which they can use to vote within the community.

Curators and volunteers who wish to document an endangered culture within their environment can open a proposal on the [community forum](https://community.savinghistory.xyz). Within 7 days, community members will agree if the open proposal should be approved or not. If approved, the curator can proceed to the protocol's [Snapshot](https://demo.snapshot.org/#/savinghistory.eth) to create an official proposal. To create this official proposal, the curator needs to have at least <u>1% of the circulating SAVEH token.</u>

Community **DAO** members who had SSAVEH token at the time the proposal was created, can go ahead and vote **"YAY"** or **"NAY."** If the "YAYs" have it, the curator can go ahead to document the endangered culture of interest. The culture's heritage will be documented in the "Histories" section of the [community forum](https://community.savinghistory.xyz). Within 7 days, community DAO members will scrutinize the submission to make sure the information is accurate, as it will be stored on IPFS permanently. After 7 days, the documented heritage will be uploaded to IPFS and the curator will be rewarded from the protocol's treasury.
